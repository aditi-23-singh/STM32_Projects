## Distributed Dual-Node Stepper Motor Control System
Bi-Directional UART Communication | Dual STM32 | TMC2208 | Event-Driven Firmware

## Project Summary

Designed and implemented a distributed embedded control architecture using two STM32F051 microcontrollers communicating over bi-directional UART, where both nodes are capable of controlling the same stepper motor through a TMC2208 driver.

The system supports:

    Motor control from either board
    Real-time command arbitration
    Single click → Start/Stop
    Double click → Reverse direction
    Long press → Mode control
    Deterministic timer-based pulse generation
    LED-assisted hardware debugging

This project demonstrates distributed embedded design, peripheral-level control, communication protocol handling, and real-time event synchronization.

## System Architecture
Both STM32 boards:
    
    Scan user inputs
    Generate control commands
    Transmit and receive via UART
    Update motor state based on synchronized command logic

Motor control authority is dynamically managed through command synchronization.

## Core Engineering Components
1. Bi-Directional UART Communication
    
    Full-duplex UART configuration
    Interrupt-driven RX handling
    Lightweight command protocol
    Conflict handling logic
    Command acknowledgment strategy

Key focus areas:

    Clock accuracy & baud rate matching
    Framing reliability
    Data integrity verification
    Real-time synchronization

This demonstrates understanding of multi-node embedded systems and communication integrity.

2️. Event-Based Input Engine

Implemented a structured FSM to detect:

    Single click
    Double click (timing window based)
    Long press
    Double click triggers direction reversal.

Key techniques:
    
    Edge detection
    Non-blocking timing logic
    Debounce filtering
    Deterministic state transitions

This reflects correct event-driven firmware design rather than delay-based logic.

3️. Deterministic Motor Control (TMC2208 – STEP/DIR Mode)

    Hardware timer-based pulse generation
    Adjustable step frequency
    Direction toggling without step loss
    Safe enable/disable sequencing
    Synchronization with UART events

Ensured:
    
    No missed steps during direction changes
    No blocking delays
    Pulse width constraints respected
    Stable motor operation under distributed command input

4️. Distributed Control Handling
    
    Since both boards can issue motor commands:
    Implemented command synchronization logic
    Prevented inconsistent motor states
    Ensured deterministic behavior under concurrent inputs

This models real-world distributed embedded systems where multiple controllers share authority.


5️. Structured Hardware Debugging

Used LED signaling as a deterministic debug interface:

    UART transmit/receive confirmation
    State machine transitions
    Direction change verification
    Error detection states

Also performed:

    Register-level inspection
    Timer debugging
    Peripheral clock validation
    Step signal probing

Demonstrates disciplined debugging methodology.

## Engineering Challenges Solved

    Reliable double-click detection under timing constraints
    UART synchronization between two MCUs
    Preventing step loss during direction reversal
    Avoiding race conditions in distributed control
    Maintaining deterministic pulse generation

## What This Project Demonstrates

This project reflects:

    Multi-controller embedded system design
    Real-time event-driven firmware
    Deterministic motor control
    Communication protocol implementation
    Structured debugging methodology
    Hardware-level reasoning under timing constraints
    It models a scaled-down version of distributed hardware control systems used in industrial and silicon enablement environments.
    Maintaining deterministic pulse generation

## Potential Extensions
    
    DMA-based UART communication
